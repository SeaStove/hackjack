  <h3>What is Card Counting?</h3>
  <p>Card Counting is used to give you a competitive edge over the "house" in blackjack. While, frowned upon it is not 
  illegal to use. This page will tell you what the true count is, what the probability of drawing every card is, and 
  whether you should stand hit or stay. We will go over the basics, but  to know more you can follow this

  <h3>Card Counting Method </h3>
  <p>We will be using the Hi-Lo Method. The Hi-Lo Method is as follows:</p>

  <p>Cards 2 through 6 are counted as "-1", 7 through 9 as "0", Tens and Aces as "+1". This is known as the "Running Count".</p>
  <p>"The "True Count" is the Running Count over the number of decks left (As shown above).</p>
